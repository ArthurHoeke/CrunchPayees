# Communal Validator Payout

This repository is managed by Paranodes and serves as the operational hub for our communal validator payout process. The primary goal is to minimize the transaction fees associated with reward payouts by batching them. This method allows us to distribute rewards to validators and nominators in a single transaction, significantly reducing costs.

## How to Join

To participate in the communal payouts, please take the following steps:

1. **Fork this repository.**
2. **Add your validator address** to the appropriate file:
   - For Polkadot validators, add your address to `polkadot_payees.txt`.
   - For Kusama validators, add your address to `Payees.txt`.
3. **Submit a pull request** with your changes. Our team will review and merge it to include your validator in the next payout cycle.

## Background and Funding

This initiative is a part of a broader effort to support the Polkadot and Kusama validator communities. It includes refunding decision deposits, submission deposits, and assisting validators, especially those from the 1KV program, with their payouts. Initially funded by Paranodes, this initiative aims to support an increasing number of validators, with plans to extend from ~10 to 50 in the first phase.

The budget and funding requirements are dynamic, influenced by the number of referenda and the count of active nominators. Currently, the operation costs are estimated between 10-15 DOT per month. To maintain and possibly expand this service, we project a potential increase to 50 DOT per month at full capacity. Continuity of service will be ensured with timely budget adjustments and community support.
